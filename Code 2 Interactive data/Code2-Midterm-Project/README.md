# Data Visualization Project: Cancer
This is a data visualization project that uses the data of cancer and how common different types of cancer are. The image of the body can be interacted with by clicking, and once clicked, a particle effect will be activated. The color, size, and emission rate reflects how common each type of cancer are within different part of the body and organs.
